Problem 1: sums all distinct elements from different sets
- "sum", "sum1", "sum2" are the variables of the sum
- "set1" is the first set
- "set2" is the second set
- "i" is the counter
  
Problem 2-v1: calculates the variable ps(scalar product) of 2 vectors using a procedure
- "dot_product" is the procedure
- "v1" is the first vector
- "v2" is the second vector
- "i" is the counter

Problem 2-v2: calculates in the variable ps(scalar product) of 2 vectors using a function
- "dot_product" is the function
- "v1" is the first vector
- "v2" is the second vector
- "ps" is the variable for the scalar product
- "i" is the counter
- "n" is the size of the vectors
